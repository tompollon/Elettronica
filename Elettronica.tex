\section{Semiconductors} \index{Semiconductors}
Semiconductors are material with an electrical conductivity value falling between that of a conductor and an insulator.
An important property of semiconductors is that, during a temperature increment, their resistance decreases.
Common semiconductors material are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \index{Silicon}Silicon, Si. Z (i.e. atomic number) = 14. IV ($14^{th}$) group.
	\item Germanium, Ge. Atomic number = 32. IV ($14^{th}$) group
	\item Gallium Arsenide, GaAs, a compound of Gallium and Arsenic.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Movement analysis of electric charge in a semiconductor bar}
Given a bar of length $\ell$, and an Electric field $E$, every electron in valence band will be affected by a force $F = q \cdot E$, and thus its acceleration $a$ will be, until the electron is subjected to the Electric field, $a(t)= \frac{F}{m} = \frac{q \cdot E}{m}$; being this quantity a constant respect to time, the speed will be a straight line with angular coefficient $m = a = \frac{q \cdot E}{ m}$:
\begin{equation}
	v(t) = \frac{q \cdot E}{m} \cdot t = a \cdot t
\end{equation}
However, scientists have observed that during its path to freedom (i.e. the end of the bar), the electrons hit some nucleus, this resetting their speed (and, by consequence, kinetic energy) to zero. 

\index{TO DO} \verb|NTtA [Note To the author]: Look up the axis measures and ticks to make it realistic. |
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}

\addlegendentry{Evolution of $v(t)$ after a hit}
%Here the blue line is defined

\node[label={180:{HIT!}},circle,fill=red,inner sep=2pt] at (axis cs:3,30) {};
\node[label={90:{$\ell$}},circle,fill,inner sep=1pt] at (axis cs:9,0) {};

\end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
In a difficult way, the average speed of the electrons can be expressed by the area underlying the red line divided by the total amount of time: $\bar{v}$ of function $v(t)$ is $\frac{1}{t_1}\int_{0}^{t_1} v(t) \cdot dt$.\\
In an easier way we can observe that between the $(i-1)^{th}$  and the $i^{th}$ hit $\bar{v_i} = \frac{h}{2} = \frac{a\cdot \Delta t}{2}$, and so $\bar{v} = \frac{\bar{h}}{n}= a \cdot \frac{\sum\Delta t}{n} = a \cdot \bar{t}$, where $n$ is the number of hits and $\bar{t}$ is the \I{average flying time}. 
By consequence
\begin{equation}
	\bar{v} = a \cdot \bar{t} = \frac{\bar{t} \cdot q}{m}\cdot E = \mu_p \cdot E
\end{equation}  
\index{Carrier Mobility}
Where we introduce the \index{Electron mobility} \B{\I{Electron Mobility}} $\mu_p$, that depends on $\bar{t}$, which is a material constant.
\begin{equation}
	\mu_p = \ [\frac{cm^2}{V \cdot s}]
\end{equation}  
Mobility is a constant even for \B{holes} and usually it is related to electron mobility by the law
\begin{equation}
	\mu_p \sim 3\mu_n
\end{equation}
where $\mu_p$ is the \I{electron mobility} and $\mu_n$ is the \I{holes mobility} \index{Holes Mobility}. 
The fact that $\mu_p > \mu_n$ doesn't surprise ourself because \B{holes} move in \I{valence band}, which is normally fulfilled of carriers, while \B{electrons} move in \I{conductance band}, where the movement is less influenced by other carriers and by nuclei.

	In the figure we can observe that mobility is negatively influenced by doping \index{doping} concentration, but positively by temperature.

\subsubsection{Numerical analysis}
Given a bar with:
\begin{itemize}
	\item left-side potential = 0 V
	\item right-side potential = $+V$ (given by a generator)
	\item bar lenght $\ell$ and area $A$
\end{itemize}
\index{TO DO} Check for signs in equations
Being $V = -\int_{0}^{\ell}Ed\ell$ and assuming the electric field $E$ being constant in the bar, $V = -E\int_{0}^{\ell}d\ell = -E\cdot{\ell}$, so we can say $|E| = \frac{V}{\ell}$.\\
By definition,
\begin{equation}
	I = \frac{\Delta Q}{t} = I_n + I_p
\end{equation} where $t$ is the transit-time and $I_n$, $I_p$ being relatively the current generated by negative carriers going to the right side of the bar (electrons) and by positive carriers going to the left side of the bar (holes). 
\subsubsection{$I_n$}
$I_n = \frac{q \cdot number \ of \ electrons}{t_{tr}}$. Being $number of electrons = n \cdot v$, where $n$ is the electrons concentration in the semiconductor bar $[\frac{electrons}{cm^3}]$ and $v= \ell \cdot A$ is the volume of the bar, we can write the following equation: $I_n = \frac{q \cdot n \cdot \ell A}{t_{tr}}$. Writing $t_{tr} = \frac{\ell}{v_n} = \frac{\ell}{\mu_p \cdot E}$ we finally can say that
\begin{equation} \label{eq:6}
\tcbhighmath[drop fuzzy shadow = green, colback = green!20!white, colframe = green]{
	I_n = \frac{q n \ell A}{\frac{\ell}{\mu_p \cdot E}} = \frac{q n \ell A}{\frac{\ell}{\mu_p \cdot \frac{V}{\ell}}}= \mu_n qn\frac{A}{\ell}\cdot V}
\end{equation}
We observe that \ref{eq:6} is the famous \B{Ohm's law} \index{Ohm's law}
\begin{equation}
	R = \frac{1}{\mu_n q n}\frac{\ell}{A}
\end{equation}
where all the variables are related to the physical state of the bar.
\subsubsection{Resistivity and conductivity}
Doing a reasoning analogue to that for $I_n$, we can observe that $I_p = \mu_p qn\frac{A}{\ell}\cdot V$. The general expression of the current intensity in the bar is so given by:
\begin{equation}
	I = (n\mu_n+p\mu_p)q\cdot \frac{\ell}{A} \cdot V
\end{equation}
\index{Resistivity}\index{Conductivity}
where the first term, $(n\mu_n+p\mu_p)q = \sigma $ is called \I{conductivity} of the material.\\
$\rho = \frac{1}{\sigma}$ is the resistivity of the material. 
Resistivity is a special characteristic of the material. 
\begin{equation}
	\rho = [cm \cdot \Omega]
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Diffusion Current} \index{Diffusion current}
WDiffusion current is a current in a semiconductor caused by the diffusion of charge carriers. 


\subsection{Semiconductors: a nuclear approach}
In 1913 Niehls Bohr \index{Nihels Bohr} proposed a model of atom in which \I{quantization of the angular momentum} \index{angular momentum} explained some interesting results regarding the light emitted by Hydrogen atoms heated. This model is very useful to explain the internal structure of atoms and can tell us something even about Silicon. A neutral Silicon atom possesses 14 protons and many electrons.
\begin{itemize}
	\item the first 10 of them lies in the first two energy level: they fit perfectly around the nucleus and  are generally not involved in chemical reactions (because of the very high amount of energy necessary to "interact" with them).
	\item the remaining 4 electrons are called \textit{valence electrons}\index{valence electrons} and are at higher energy levels. They are involved in the \textit{covalent bond}.
\end{itemize}
When temperature is near at the absolute zero ($-273^o C$) the Silicon atoms assume a crystal form in which every \textit{valence electron} is shared with the nearest 4 atoms of Silicon with a covalent bond: in this circumstance Silicon act as an \textbf{insulator}.
At higher temperatures, (i. e. furnishing energy to the atom) covalent bounds can break. 
\subsubsection{Electrons and Holes}
When the break happens, an electron \I{jumps} from valence band to conduction band and a hole is generated. The conduction-band electron is now a \B{charge carrier} and the atom it left is a charged positively (cation). 
\subsubsection{Valence and conduction bands}
Without the necessary energy, electrons remain under the \I{Fermi level}, in a zone called \I{Valence Band}. when the \I{jump} occurs, electrons step over the \I{Fermi level} and stay in the \I{conduction band}. In the conduction band charge carrier have less constraints and can easily move in the crystalline lattice, depending on the intensity of the electro-magnetic field.
\subsubsection{Silicon properties}
\bite
	\item The amount of charge carriers in a $cm^3$ (i.e. electrons in the conduction band) at ambient temperature $n = 10^{10} cm^{-3}$. It is reasonably a little number compared to the global amount of atoms in a Silicon $cm^3$ ($5 \cdot 10^{22}$). [Think that if atoms were people on earth, only 7 people would result a cation with the loss of their electron]. 
	\item It is compatible with $SiO_2$ and $Al$
\fite

\subsection{Doping}
The doping process consists in significantly change the number of \textit{electrons }or \textit{holes} in a semiconductor.
This result is achieved inserting atoms of the doping element in the crystalline arrangement of the doped.
\subsubsection{Utilities and numbers}
\begin{itemize}
	\item $N_{d} \approxeq 10^{12} : 10^{20} cm^{-3}$ number of donors
	\item $p 	[\dfrac{electrons}{cm^3}]$ number of holes 
	\item $n 	[\dfrac{electrons}{cm^3}]$ number of electrons 
\end{itemize}
Remember that:
\begin{itemize}
	\item n-doping leaves free electron in conduction band and is obtained by inserting DONORS atoms of $Phosphorus$, or other elements from the V$^{th}$ group.
	\item p-doping creates holes in the lattice structure and is obtained by inserting ACCEPTORS atoms of $Boron$, or other elements from the III$^{th}$ group. 
\end{itemize}




\section{Diodes}
Diodes are defined as a p-n junction.
\begin{circuitikz}
	\draw (0,0) to[Do, l=$Diode$, i>^=$i$, v = $v$] (2,0);3
\end{circuitikz}
Is is made by two parts: the left part (according to the figure) is a p-doped semiconductor in which there are holes left.
The other part, on the contrary, is n-doped in which there are electrons left.

	\end{equation} Note that the Electric field is a \B{CONSERVATIVE FIELD}\\
\index{Conservative field} 
	A conservative field is a field in which the \I{Work} done for placing an element from a point $a$ to a point $b$ depends only from the different location of $a$ and $b$ and not by the route done.\\

\index{Work} The \I{Work} in a conservative field is defined as follows:
		\begin{equation}
			W_{a\to b} = \int_{a}^{b} \overrightarrow{F}(x)dx = q (V_b - V_a)d
		\end{equation}\\
\index{Potential Energy} The \I{Potential energy} of a charge subjected to an Electric field is 
	\begin{equation}
		U = q V [eV]
	\end{equation} and the measure unit is the electronVolt $eV$, where $1 eV = 1,6 \ 10^{-19} J$, the energy necessary to move an electron from a point $a$ to a point $b$ with $V_a-V_b= 1 V$.

\index{Electric Potential}The \I{Electric Potential} at a point $r$ in an Electric Field $E$ is given by 
	\begin{equation}
		V_E = -\int_{C}E \cdot \mathrm{d} \boldsymbol{\ell}
	\end{equation}
	Where $C$ is an arbitrary path from the point $r$ to the point with zero potential. \\

\index{Electric Current} The \I{Electric Current} is defined as $i$ (from the french \I{intensité du courant}):
	\begin{equation}
		I = \frac{Q}{t} = \frac{V}{R} \ \ \ \ \ [Amp]
	\end{equation}

\section{Engineer's corner}
\subsection*{Question 1: How much is $1 C$?} \index{Coulomb}
At first attempt we can say that 1 $Coulomb$ is \I{very} approximately $10^{19}$ times the fundamental charge unit (the electron). However it is a bit difficult rendering the idea of $10^{19}$ electrons. \\
Thinking about batteries, a common \I{AAA} battery has a capacity of 540 $mAh$, which are equivalent to 1944 $C$. \\
A common \I{AA} battery has a charge of 9 $kC$. \\
In everyday terms, a Coulomb is $\frac{1}{2000}$ times the charge occurring to empty a normal AAA battery.

%Below is an example of the problem environment
\begin{problem}{6}
\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]
    \item Suppose an entire function $f$ is bounded by $M$ along $|z|=R$. Show that the coefficients $C_k$ in its power series expansion about $0$ satisfy
    \[
    |C_k|\leq\frac{M}{R^k}.
    \]
    \item Suppose a polynomial is bounded by $1$ in the unit disc. Show that all its coefficients are bounded by 1.
\end{enumerate}
\end{problem}

%Below is the solution environment
\begin{solution}{}
Part a): Since $f$ is an entire function it can be expressed as an infinite power series, i.e.
\[
f(z)=\sum_{k=0}^\infty\frac{f^{(k)}(0)}{k!}z^k=\sum_{k=0}^\infty C_kz^k.
\]
If we recall Cauchy's Integral we have
\[
f(z)=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_\gamma\frac{f(w)}{w-z}\ dw,
\]
carefully notice that $\frac{1}{w-z}=\frac{1}{w}\cdot\frac{1}{1-\frac{z}{w}}$ can be written as a geometric series. We have

%The align environment with no label
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_\gamma\frac{f(w)}{w-z}\ dw &=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_\gamma\left\lbrace\frac{f(w)}{w}\cdot\left(\frac{1}{1-\frac{z}{w}}\right) \right\rbrace\ dw\\[8pt]
&=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_\gamma\left\lbrace\frac{f(w)}{w}\cdot\left(1+\frac{z}{w}+\frac{z^2}{w^2}+\frac{z^3}{w^3}+\cdots\right) \right\rbrace\ dw\\[8pt]
&=\left(\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_\gamma \frac{f(w)}{w}\ dw\right)z^0+\left(\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_\gamma \frac{f(w)}{w^2}\ dw\right)z^1+\left(\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_\gamma \frac{f(w)}{w^3}\ dw\right)z^2\cdots
\end{align*}
Now take the modulus of $C_k$ to get
\[
|C_k|=\left\lvert\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_\gamma \frac{f(w)}{w^{k+1}}\ dw \right\rvert\leq\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_\gamma\frac{|f(w)|}{|w^{k+1}|}\ |dw|\leq \frac{M}{2\pi}\int_\gamma\frac{|dw|}{|w^{k+1}|}
\]
Then integrate along $\gamma(\theta)=Re^{i\theta}$ for $\theta\in [0,2\pi]$ to get
\[
|C_k|\leq \frac{M}{2\pi}\int_0^{2\pi}\frac{|iRe^{i\theta}\ d\theta|}{|R^{k+1}e^{ik\theta}|}=\frac{M}{2\pi\cdot R^k}\int_0^{2\pi}\ d\theta=\frac{M}{R^k}.
\]
Hence, $|C_k|\leq \frac{M}{R^k}$.
\end{solution}
